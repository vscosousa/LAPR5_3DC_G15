# Analysis

The process of building the domain model is based on the client's specifications, especially the nouns (for concepts) and verbs (for relationships) used.

## Rationale for identifying domain conceptual classes ##

To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development".

### **Rationale for identifying associations between conceptual classes** ###

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection that is worth remembering, or is derivable from the Common Associations List:


| Concept (A)   |  Association |  Concept (B)  |
| ------------- |:------------:| ------------: |
| example | has | example |
