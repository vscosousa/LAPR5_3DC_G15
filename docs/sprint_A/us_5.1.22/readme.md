# US 5.1.22 - As an Admin, I want to remove obsolete or no longer performed operation types - DELETE

## 1. Context

 `Description:` As an Admin, I want to remove obsolete or no longer performed operation types, so that the system stays current with hospital practices.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Admins can search for and mark operation types as inactive (rather than deleting them) to preserve historical records.
- Inactive operation types are no longer available for future scheduling but remain in historical data.
- A confirmation prompt is shown before deactivating an operation type.

 `Sprint:` This US makes part of the first stage of development of the integrative project of this semester, Sprint A.

`Objectives:` The Admin can deactivate operation types that are no longer performed.
