# US 5.1.10 - As an Admin, I want to delete a patient profile - DELETE

## 1. Context

 `Description:` As an Admin, I want to delete a patient profile, so that I can remove patients who are no longer under car.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Admins can search for a patient profile and mark it for deletion.
- Before deletion, the system prompts the admin to confirm the action.
- Once deleted, all patient data is permanently removed from the system within a predefined time frame.
- The system logs the deletion for audit and GDPR compliance purposes.

 `Sprint:` This US makes part of the first stage of development of the integrative project of this semester, Sprint A.

`Objectives:` The Admin can delete any patient registered in the system.
