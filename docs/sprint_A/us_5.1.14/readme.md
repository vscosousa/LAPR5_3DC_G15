# US 5.1.14 - As an Admin, I want to deactivate a staff profile - PUT/PATCH

## 1. Context

 `Description:` As an Admin, I want to deactivate a staff profile, so that I can remove them from the hospitalâ€™s active roster without losing their historical data.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Admins can search for and select a staff profile to deactivate.
- Deactivating a staff profile removes them from the active roster, but their historical data (e.g., appointments) remains accessible.
- The system confirms deactivation and records the action for audit purposes.

 `Sprint:` This US makes part of the first stage of development of the integrative project of this semester, Sprint A.

`Objectives:` The Admin can deactivate staff profiles.
