# US 5.1.7 - As a Patient, I want to log in to the healthcare system using IAM - POST

## 1. Context

 `Description:` As a Patient, I want to log in to the healthcare system using my external IAM credentials, so that I can access my appointments, medical records, and other features securely.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Patients log in via an external Identity and Access Management (IAM) provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, or hospital SSO).
- After successful authentication via the IAM, patients are redirected to the healthcare system with a valid session.
- Patients have access to their appointment history, medical records, and other features relevant to their profile.
- Sessions expire after a defined period of inactivity, requiring reauthentication.


 `Sprint:` This US makes part of the first stage of development of the integrative project of this semester, Sprint A.

`Objectives:` Users can log in with IAM System.
