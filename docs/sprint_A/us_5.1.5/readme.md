# US 5.1.5 - As a Patient, I want to delete my account and all associated data - DELETE

## 1. Context

 `Description:` As a Patient, I want to delete my account and all associated data, so that I can exercise my right to be forgotten as per GDPR.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Patients can request to delete their account through the profile settings.
- The system sends a confirmation email to the patient before proceeding with account deletion.
- Upon confirmation, all personal data is permanently deleted from the system within the legally required time frame (e.g.: 30 days).
- Patients are notified once the deletion is complete, and the system logs the action for GDPR compliance.
- Some anonymized data may be retained for legal or research purposes, but all identifiable information is erased.



 `Sprint:` This US makes part of the first stage of development of the integrative project of this semester, Sprint A.

`Objectives:` Patients can delete their own account any time.
