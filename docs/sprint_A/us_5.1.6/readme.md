# US 5.1.6 - As a (non-authenticated) Backoffice User, I want to log in to the system using my credentials - POST

## 1. Context

 `Description:` As a (non-authenticated) Backoffice User, I want to log in to the system using my credentials, so that I can access the backoffice features according to my assigned role.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Backoffice users log in using their username and password.
- Role-based access control ensures that users only have access to features appropriate to their role (e.g., doctors can manage appointments, admins can manage users and settings).
- After five failed login attempts, the user account is temporarily locked, and a notification is sent to the admin.
- Login sessions expire after a period of inactivity to ensure security

 `Sprint:` This US makes part of the first stage of development of the integrative project of this semester, Sprint A.

`Objectives:` Users can log in to the system with their own credentials.
