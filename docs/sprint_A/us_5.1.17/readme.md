# US 5.1.17 - As a Doctor, I want to update an operation requisition - PUT/PATCH

## 1. Context

 `Description:` As a Doctor, I want to update an operation requisition, so that the Patient has access to the necessary healthcare.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Doctors can update operation requests they created (e.g., change the deadline or priority).
- The system checks that only the requesting doctor can update the operation request.
- The system logs all updates to the operation request (e.g., changes to priority or deadline).
- Updated requests are reflected immediately in the system and notify the Planning Module of any changes.

 `Sprint:` This US makes part of the first stage of development of the integrative project of this semester, Sprint A.

`Objectives:` The Doctor can update an operation requisition at any time.
