# US 5.1.21 - As an Admin, I want to edit existing operation types - PUT/PATCH

## 1. Context

 `Description:` As an Admin, I want to edit existing operation types, so that I can update or correct information about the procedure.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Admins can search for and select an existing operation type to edit.
- Editable fields include operation name, required staff by specialization, and estimated duration.
- Changes are reflected in the system immediately for future operation requests.
- Historical data is maintained, but new operation requests will use the updated operation type information.

`Objectives:` The Admin can edit existing operation types at any time.
