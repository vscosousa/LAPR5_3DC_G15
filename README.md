# Project Surgical Appointment and Resource Management

## 1. Description of the Project

As part of the LEI ([Licenciatura Engenharia Inform√°tica](https://www.isep.ipp.pt/Course/Course/26)) degree's integrative project at ISEP ([Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto](https://www.isep.ipp.pt)) for the 2024/2025 academic year, we are embarking on a project to develop a prototype system for chirurgic requests, appointment, and resource management. The system will enable hospitals and clinics to manage surgery appointments, and patient records. It will also offer real-time 3D visualization of resource availability within the facility and optimize scheduling and resource usage. Furthermore, the project will address GDPR compliance, ensuring the system meets data protection and consent management requirements.
