# Project Surgical Appointment and Resource Management

## 1. Description of the Project

As part of the LEI ([Licenciatura Engenharia Inform√°tica](https://www.isep.ipp.pt/Course/Course/26)) degree's integrative project at ISEP ([Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto](https://www.isep.ipp.pt)) for the 2024/2025 academic year, we are embarking on a project to develop a prototype system for surgical requests, appointment, and resource management. The system will enable hospitals and clinics to manage surgery appointments and patient records. It will also offer real-time 3D visualization of resource availability within the facility and optimize scheduling and resource usage. Furthermore, the project will address GDPR compliance, ensuring the system meets data protection and consent management requirements.

3. A web browser will automatically open and navigate to the appropriate URL to interact with the application.

**Note:** Currently, we are using Swagger for API documentation and testing. You can access the Swagger UI at `https://localhost:5001/swagger` once the application is running.

## 5. How to Execute Tests

To execute tests for the Surgical Appointment and Resource Management system:

1. Run the following command to execute the tests:

    ```sh
    dotnet test
    ```
    
2. The test results will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt. You can also configure the test runner to generate test reports in various formats.

## 6. How to Execute Postman Tests

To run Postman tests for the Surgical Appointment and Resource Management system:

1. Ensure you have [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) installed on your machine.
2. Open Postman and access our shared workspace. You will need an invitation to join the workspace.
3. Make sure the application is running. Refer to the [How to Run](#4-how-to-run) section for instructions.
4. In Postman, navigate to the shared workspace and select the relevant collection.
