As an Admin, I want to know till what dimension in terms of number of surgeries is possible to ask for the better solution.
Perform a complexity analysis of the problem to understand to which dimension it is feasible to ask for the better solution. 
Document your results and findings.

Complexity Analysis:
| Number of Surgeries | Number of operations | Best schedule of activities (including surgeries) of the operation room | Final Time for the last surgery (minutes) | Time to generate solution (s) |
